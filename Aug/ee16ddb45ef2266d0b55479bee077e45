CAPE TOWN (Reuters) â€“ Steinhoff will struggle to turn a profit in coming years despite strong turnover as it restructures following an accounting scandal, the South African retailer said in a presentation to investors on Tuesday. Steinhoff in July reported a 356 million euro ($401 million) half-year loss from continuing operations. Since flagging holes in its accounts in December 2017, estimates of losses stemming from alleged accounting fraud are now as high $7 billion.
