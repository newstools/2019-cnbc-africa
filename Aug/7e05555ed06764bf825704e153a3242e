South Africa’s digital Bank TymeBank has appointed  Tauriq Keraan as its new Chief Executive Officer (CEO). He replaces Sandile Shabalala. See statement below: Tauriq previously held the position of deputy CEO. He has played an
instrumental role in the bank’s development, having been a member of the team that
led to Tyme’s inception in 2012 and having played a critical role in the market
launch of TymeBank in 2019. He succeeds former CEO Sandile Shabalala who resigned
in June for personal reasons. Tauriq takes the reins as the bank reached the 600 000
customer mark, five months after its official launch in February. Dr Johan van Zyl, co-Chief
Executive Officer of African Rainbow Capital, the controlling shareholder of
TymeBank comments: “Tauriq takes the reins at an important point in TymeBank’s evolution
as he has to ensure customer enrolment is sustained over the coming months and
beyond. Given his experience, both as a member of the team that launched TymeBank,
and as someone who has worked in the space of digital innovation for more than
a decade, both the TymeBank board and ARC, believe he will lead his executive
team to implement the business strategy successfully.” Mr Thabani Jali, Chairman of
TymeBank, comments: “We are pleased that Tauriq will take up the position of CEO of TymeBank
as it will ensure continuity in the business. He is a seasoned executive who
will continue to build TymeBank in its efforts to deliver affordable and
accessible banking to our customers. Under Tauriq’s leadership, management will
continue implementing the bank’s existing strategy.” TymeBank offers consumers a compelling value proposition in terms of its
current low to no fee EveryDay bank account offering and attractive GoalSave
product that is distributed through digital channels and Pick n Pay and Boxer
stores. Tauriq comments: “We have a highly capable and committed team as well as a strong and
supportive board to ensure we deliver on our strategic priorities.  Our customer enrolment numbers and activity
rates are ahead of our business case and the business is likely to sustain this
momentum over the coming months. Over the next 6 to 12 months, we will also deepen
the way in which we meet customers’ needs by launching an account for small
businesses, responsibly offering consumers unsecured credit as well as serving
a million consumers by year-end.” TymeBank management previously communicated that the overall market
size of its target segment is estimated at about 20 million people of which it
is aiming to acquire 2 million over a three-year period. Tauriq comments further: “TymeBank is geared to meet the needs of consumers in this market
segment responsibly and affordably. This will facilitate financial inclusion,
which is core to TymeBank’s ethos. Since I first started working in the space
of financial inclusion and digital banking over 10 years ago, helping people
improve their financial well-being through affordable, accessible and dignified
banking has been a passion of mine. “We’re achieving this through digital banking innovation that uses cutting-edge
technology, alternative distribution models and deep data-driven insights to
better understand customers’ behaviour and needs and meet them in a relevant,
responsible and cost-effective way.” The leadership change is effective immediately.
