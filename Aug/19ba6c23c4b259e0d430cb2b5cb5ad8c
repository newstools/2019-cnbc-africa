Preparations for the Zambia game are underway and the national team has been training hard from Kyadondo Rugby Grounds ahead of Saturday's game. Some players are returning from Injury to boost the team including Ian Muyani and Justine Kimono who both missed the game against Zimbabwe and will give the coach more selection options. The players have had a two weeks rest between the games and thus much fresher.  “We have registered lots of improvement especially in decision making and individual skills.”- Coach Seguya Robert With loses to Kenya and Zimbabwe, management of the Uganda Rugby Cranes team are hopeful that this training will yield good results for Uganda in this last home fixture before they embark on a two week tour of Zimbabwe and Zambia.
