The training was requested by the Chief of Defense Staff, General Biague Nantan, to improve the technical capacity of his personnel and enhance their ability to communicate both internally and externally, bringing the military closer to the civil society. “Nothing can improve more the image and professionalism of the Guinea-Bissau armed forces than positive strategic communication” said the General, handing over a gift of appreciation to Colonel Botelho, UNIOGBIS’ Senior Military Adviser.
