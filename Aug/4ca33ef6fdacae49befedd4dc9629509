The Zambia National Rugby Team is this weekend facing a litmus test as they face Rugby Africa 2nd placed Kenya in an away fixture at the RFUEA Grounds in Nairobi.  This will be the pair's second meeting in less than a month after the latter beat their hosts in a jaw dropping encounter played at Diggers Rugby Club in Kitwe. Zambia, who are yet to record a win in their inaugural Victoria Cup tournament, are looking at upsetting their hosts in this first return match. The Southern AfricanÂ nation is looking to redeem herself from the 43-23 loss to Kenya as they start their return fixtures. Despite the hazy start to their Victoria Cup campaign, local rugby fans in Zambia are still confident of a good finish. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Zambia Rugby Union (ZRU).
