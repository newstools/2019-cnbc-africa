Operating and Financial Highlights Revenue for the second quarter of 2019 is $160 million, growing 22% year-over-year 	Net Income for the second quarter of 2019 is $11 million, an increase of $17 million year-over-year on a combined basis 	Adjusted Net Income (a non-GAAP measure) for the second quarter of 2019 is $16 million, up 13% sequentially* 	Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) is $46 million as compared to $34 million in the prior year combined period, producing year-over year-growth of over 33%* 	Diluted Earnings per Share (EPS) for the second quarter of 2019 is $0.13, which included $0.06 per share of Charges and Credits 	Adjusted Diluted EPS (a non-GAAP measure) for the second quarter of 2019 is $0.19* Sherif Foda, Chairman of the Board and CEO of NESR said, “We are very delighted with our outstanding results this quarter. We celebrated the first-year anniversary of the Company in June and it is amazing how much has been achieved in such a short time. In this quarter alone, along with the refinancing of our debt facility at very favorable terms, we have secured and expanded our core contracts in Saudi Arabia for more than 5 years. We continue to make inroads in new countries like Bahrain as we did earlier in Kuwait and Chad. With these and all of the incremental contracts we have won over the last year, we are in a very strong position to kick off the remaining part of the year and the foreseeable future.” Mr. Foda continued, “As we have been continuously emphasizing since last year, the MENA region will be at the forefront of the international recovery and spending will continue to grow. This is now being recognized with broad market acceptance. We believe that as the National Champion of the region, we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this ongoing activity growth. We are presently growing at more than double the rate and we believe we can further accelerate this growth in the coming quarters with the commencement of several of our previously announced and upcoming projects. We are proud to be from the region and aspire to continue to be key partners to our customers who share our vision of creating long-term sustainable In-Country Value. Our recently approved Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy is designed to deliver long-term economic, social and environmental value to all the communities we operate in.” Net Income Results The Company had net income for the second quarter of 2019 totaling $11.4 million as compared to a net loss of $5.5 million for the second quarter of 2018. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2019 is $16.4 million and includes adjustments totaling $5.1 million mainly related to integration and restructuring costs, exceptional interest charges, and other discrete provisions (collectively, “Total Charges and Credits”). A complete list of the adjusting items and associated reconciliation from GAAP has been provided in Table 1 below in the section entitled “Total Charges and Credits.” The effective tax rate for the Company for the three-month period ended June 30, 2019 is 21% as adjusted for Total Charges and Credits. The Company reported $0.13 of diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2019 compared to $0.00 per share during the Predecessor second quarter period of 2018, a loss per share of $0.05 during the Successor second quarter period of 2018, and $0.15 per share during the first quarter 2019 period. Adjusted for the impact of Total Charges and Credits described in Table 1 below, Adjusted EPS for the second quarter of 2019 is $0.19. See “Business Combination Accounting and Presentation of Results of Operations” section below for additional information on current reporting conventions. EBITDA Results The Company produced Adjusted EBITDA of $45.7 million during the second quarter of 2019. Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for certain Total Charges and Credits (those not related to interest, taxes, and/or depreciation and amortization) of $2.9 million. The NESR companies collectively posted the following results for the periods presented. (in thousands) Successor NESR Successor NESR Combined NPS, GES and NESR April 1 to 			June 30, 2019 January 1 to March 31, 2019 April 1 to 			June 30, 2018 Revenue $ 159,899 $ 151,704 $ 131,355 Net Income $ 11,356 $ 13,174 $ (5,465 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 45,714 $ 40,723 $ 34,257 Production Services Segment Results The Production Services segment contributed $95.4 million to consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to $86.9 million during the second quarter of 2018 and $92.1 million of revenue during the prior quarter. Segment EBITDA totaled $33.8 million in the second quarter of 2019, improving 6.6% as compared to $31.7 million in the prior quarter and 35% as compared to $25.0 million in the second quarter of 2018. The Production Services segment continued to grow quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, with increases driven in the second quarter of 2019 by higher coil tubing and stimulation activities in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates. The Production Services segment posted the following results for the periods presented. (in thousands) Successor NESR Successor NESR Combined 			NPS, GES and NESR April 1 to 			June 30, 2019 January 1 to March 31, 2019 April 1 to 			June 30, 2018 Revenue $ 95,358 $ 92,113 $ 86,936 EBITDA $ 33,764 $ 31,661 $ 25,014 Drilling and Evaluation Services Segment Results The Drilling and Evaluation (“D&E”) Services segment contributed $64.5 million to consolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2019 as compared to revenue of $44.4 million in the second quarter of 2018 and $59.6 million during the prior quarter. The D&E Services segment revenue has grown by over 45% over the past year as the Company continues to actively cross-sell its portfolio in the countries where it did not previously provide those services. Segment EBITDA totaled $15.0 million in the second quarter of 2019, improving 39.8% as compared to $10.7 million in the prior quarter, and 105.3% as compared to $7.3 million in the prior year quarter. The D&E Services segment posted the following results for the periods presented. (in thousands) Successor NESR Successor NESR Combined 			NPS, GES and NESR April 1 to 			June 30, 2019 January 1 to March 31, 2019 April 1 to 			June 30, 2018 Revenue $ 64,541 $ 59,591 $ 44,419 EBITDA $ 14,943 $ 10,688 $ 7,278  Offsetting both the Production Services segment and D&E Services segment results were certain corporate costs, which are not allocated to segment operations. Balance Sheet Cash and cash equivalents are $69.6 million as of June 30, 2019, compared to $24.9 million as of December 31, 2018. As previously disclosed, the Company completed a $525 million refinancing of existing debt in the second quarter of 2019. Total debt as of June 30, 2019 is $366.5 million with $5.3 million of such debt classified as short-term. Working capital for the Company totaled $229.7 million as of June 30, 2019. Net debt totaled $296.9 million as of June 30, 2019. Net debt has increased by $19.7 million since December 31, 2018 to fund working capital growth as well as a consequence of a slowdown in collections in some countries. While collections are approximately $35.0 million below the prior year run rate, we expect collections to improve during the second half of 2019. Predecessor/Successor Accounting Treatment NESR continues to report in a Predecessor/Successor format whereby NPS Holdings Limited (“NPS”) is the Predecessor for periods prior to the completion of the Business Combination on June 7, 2018 and NESR, including NPS and Gulf Energy S.A.O.C. (“GES”), is the Successor for post-transaction periods. Conference Call Information NESR will host a conference call on Wednesday, August 7, 2019, to discuss second quarter financial results. The call will begin at 9:00 AM Eastern Time.

Business Combination Accounting and Presentation of Results of Operations: As a result of the Business Combination, NESR was determined to be the accounting acquirer and NPS was determined to be the predecessor for SEC reporting purposes. Pursuant to Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), the acquisition-date fair value of the purchase consideration paid by NESR to affect the Business Combination was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. As a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting resulting from the Business Combination, the financial statements and certain footnote presentations separate the Company’s presentations into two distinct sets of reporting periods, the periods before the consummation of the transaction (“Predecessor Periods”) and the period after that date (“Successor Period”), to indicate the application of the different basis of accounting between the periods presented. The Predecessor Periods reflect the historical financial information of NPS prior to the Business Combination, while the Successor Period reflects the Company’s consolidated financial information, including the results of NPS and GES, after the Business Combination. The successor periods are from June 7, 2018 to June 30, 2018 (“2018 Successor Period”), January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 (“2019 Successor Period”), and April 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 (“2019 Successor Quarter) and the predecessor periods are from January 1, 2018 to June 6, 2018 (“2018 Predecessor Period”) and April 1, 2018 to June 6, 2018 (“2018 Predecessor Quarter”).

AND SUBSIDIARIES RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME TO NET INCOME (Unaudited) (In US$ thousands) The Company uses and presents certain key non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its business and trends, measure performance, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. Included in this release are discussions of earnings before interest, income tax and depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain non-recurring and non-core expenses (“Adjusted EBITDA”), net income adjusted for certain non-recurring and non-core expenses (“Adjusted Net Income”) as well a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to net income in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income provides useful information to investors in assessing its financial performance and results of operations as the Company’s board of directors, management and investors use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to compare the Company’s operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of changes in capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization and impairment), items that do not impact the ongoing operations (Business Combination transaction expenses and related integration costs) and items outside the control of its management team. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income should not be considered as an alternative to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You should not consider non-GAAP measures in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP.
