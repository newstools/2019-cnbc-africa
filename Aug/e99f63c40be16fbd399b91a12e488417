Saturday 10th August Thousand Hills vs Muhanga thunders 1pm Lion de Fer vs Resilience 3pm Rusizi-based Resilience RFC will throw everything they have at Lion de Fer in this year’s National Rugby League semi-final playoffs on Saturday afternoon in Kigali Kacyiru Red Cross ground. Resilience finished top of the Southern League and have already faced Lion de Fer twice.According to their captain Donatien Ufitimfura, that experience will come in handy in saturday’s clash. “We have played them twice before, so we know their strengths and flaws. To be honest, we didn’t know we would make it this far in this season and we can still go all the way to the final,” said Ufitimfura. Lion de Fer will be hoping to exploit their limited pedigree. The Lions scrumhalh, Ikorikwishaka Patricksays, “Rusizi don’t have much experience and we have a superior pack, which we will try to maximize for possession and attacking.” In the other semi-final, Kigali League leaders and hosts Thousand Hills RFC take on Muhanga Thunders, who finished second in the Southern League. The final will be played on 31 august. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Rwanda Rugby Federation (RRF).
