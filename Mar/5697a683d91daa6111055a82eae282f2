Hon Ben Wallace MP, and the Kenyan Cabinet Secretary for the Interior & Coordination of National Government, Dr Fred Matiang’i, co-chaired the second high level UK-Kenya security dialogue. The UK’s Minister of State for Africa, Harriett Baldwin MP, and the Minister of State for the Commonwealth and the UN, Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon, also participated in the dialogue.  During two days of wide-ranging and productive discussions our two countries agreed to further deepen co-operation across the full sweep of our mutual security interests. This includes working together on community policing, efforts to tackle violent extremism, serious organised crime, cyber security, counter-terrorism and our defence partnership. As close partners on regional as well as international security issues, the British and Kenyan governments also committed to continue working together to promote stability and prosperity in our two countries, East Africa and the wider world.
