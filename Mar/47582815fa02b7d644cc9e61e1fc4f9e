NAIROBI (Reuters) – The Kenyan shilling edged down against the dollar on Wednesday due to dollar demand from the manufacturing and energy sector outweighing inflows from diaspora remittances, traders said. At 0800 GMT, commercial banks quoted the shilling at 100.05/25 per dollar, compared with 99.85/100.05 at Tuesday’s close. Reporting by John Ndiso; Editing by Clement Uwiringiyimana
