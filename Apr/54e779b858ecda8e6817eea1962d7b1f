Designed to address market demand for cloud-based capture and output solutions, uniFLOW Online 2019.1 offers partners the centralised management features to streamline integration, boost productivity and help businesses gain control of their costs. With easier setup than ever before and enhanced flexibility, partners have a clear opportunity to improve their offering, stand out from their competitors and reduce the time needed for service calls. Simple installation Gaining accreditation is vastly simplified, with only six hours of e-learning courses to train partners on installation, user set-up and device management. With demands on time subsequently reduced, more resource can be focused on customer needs.  The Device Setup Utility function, which now fully supports eULM devices, provides a single tool which enables partners to quickly add or update devices simultaneously. Additionally, an Online Setup button removes the complexity of onboarding, by connecting users directly from the device. This enables the delivery of industry-leading device management as easily as flipping a switch. With no need for an onsite engineer, small and large enterprises alike benefit from time and resource savings. Improved flexibility Partners directly benefit from an industry-leading cloud solution with minimal technical or financial demands. This is made available through three different packages; basic printing, basic scanning and advanced scanning, with different payment tiers.  Our most versatile cloud-based print and output management solution yet, uniFLOW Online 2019.1 allows customers to easily browse, print and queue documents stored in cloud services without any investment in servers or IT infrastructure.
