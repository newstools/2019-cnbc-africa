Download logo The Secretary-General strongly condemns the attack by unidentified gunmen, on 1 December, on a congregation attending a church service in Hantoukoura, a village in eastern Burkina Faso. The Secretary-General conveys his deep condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the people and Government of Burkina Faso. He also wishes a speedy recovery to those who were injured.
