Download logo Michael R. Pompeo, Secretary Of State  On behalf of the Government of the United States of America, I offer my congratulations to the people of Kenya on the occasion of Kenya’s 56th Jamhuri Day. This year, we reflect on the increasingly strong bonds between the United States and Kenya following the elevation of our relationship to a strategic partnership and the launch of the inaugural Bilateral Strategic Dialogue.  We look forward to deepening our cooperation through the five pillars of economic prosperity, defense, security and governance, multilateral and regional affairs, and health. I would like to convey my regards to the Kenyan people and best wishes for peace and prosperity in the year to come. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of U.S. Department of State.
