The Competition Commission’s data services market inquiry has found that mobile data in South African is too expensive.  MTN and Vodacom have been found to charge more for data prices in South Africa than any other country that they operate in. The commission has given service providers a two month notice to reduce its data prices or face prosecution. CNBC Africa’s Kopano Gumbi filed this report.
