Press Release Johannesburg, 25 July 2019 –  The South African Institute of Chartered Accountants (SAICA) has suspended Mr. Markus Jooste’s membership pending the finalisation of disciplinary proceedings against him. Jooste tendered his
resignation from SAICA in a letter received from his lawyers on 14 June 2019.
Citing the reasons for his resignation, Jooste’s lawyers allege that the
outcome of the proposed disciplinary enquiry against their client has been
predetermined by SAICA, following media reports in which SAICA CEO, Mr. Freeman
Nomvalo, confirmed that SAICA will be proceeding with a disciplinary enquiry
against Jooste. SAICA’s Board considered
Jooste’s resignation at its meeting on 26 June 2019. The Board resolved not to
accept Jooste’s resignation and to suspend his membership pending the finalisation
of disciplinary proceedings against him. The Board’s decision not to accept
Jooste’s resignation and to suspend his membership pending the finalisation of
disciplinary proceedings against him, was made in terms of SAICA’s By-laws and
was conveyed as such to Jooste’s lawyers. SAICA’s By-laws are
designed to ensure that its disciplinary enquiries are conducted in an
independent, lawful and fair manner. Moreover, SAICA has pointed out to
Jooste’s lawyers that their client cannot avoid the disciplinary enquiry that
SAICA has decided to initiate against Jooste by handing in his resignation. Sent on behalf of
Freeman Nomvalo, SAICA Chief Executive Officer.
