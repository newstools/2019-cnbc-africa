Eskom has seconded Saica’s CEO Freeman Nomvalo to be its chief restructuring officer, a position that was created by Treasury to ensure that its funding of parastatals doesn’t fall down a bottomless pit. This comes as the power utility announced a loss of almost R21 billion and yesterday appointed its chairman Jabu Mabuza as interim CEO of Eskom. See Public Enterprises statement below:– With respect to the announcement this afternoon at the Eskom annual results presentation by Mr Pravin Gordhan, the Minister of Public Enterprises on the appointment of a Chief Restructuring Officer (CRO) for Eskom, the Ministry of Public Enterprises wishes to provide clarity on the following: ·        The board
