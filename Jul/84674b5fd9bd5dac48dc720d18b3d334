Zuma sounded a little bitter as he hinted that he was going to retaliate and told of the pain suffered by his family. Former President Jacob Zuma said the “Zuma must go” campaign
of 2017 where hundreds of thousands  of South Africans took to the streets
to protest against him was part of the intelligence-fuelled campaign to vilify
him that upset his family. Zuma was giving evidence to the Zondo Commission on State Capture in Johannesburg where he is expected to answer questions on the controversial Gupta family and alleged corruption in the function of the government of his day.

Zuma must go. What can be done? No one can do anything he is corrupt.
What has he done ? Nothing. No president has been brought before a commission
but if it is Zuma we must do it…Zuma must resign. It is part of the
intelligence plan against me. Then he must be brought before the commission and
answer questions,” he said. Zuma sounded a little bitter as he hinted that he was going
to retaliate and told of the pain suffered by his family. I have been provoked and provoked to the last degree, by
people purporting to save the country they make stories they do everything. My
own family suffered out of this leaving me, as a soldier I can take everything,
people forget I have a family who do not want to hear lies being told against
me.” The hearing continues.
