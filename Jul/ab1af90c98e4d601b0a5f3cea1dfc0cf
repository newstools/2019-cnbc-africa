The Ambassador, Anne Sophie Avé welcomed members of the political community, traditional leaders, members of the diplomatic corps in Accra, many local personalities and the French community in Ghana.  The Ghanaian Government was represented by H.E Cynthia Mamle Morrison, responsible for the Ministry of Women and Children’s Affairs. Ambassador Anne Sophie Avé and the Minister both delivered a warm speech on the Franco-Ghanaian friendship and spoke at length about the recent visit of President Akufo-Addo to France. The festivities then began with an acrobatic performance by “The Ghana Flying Stars” and a breath-taking fireworks display. The celebration took place in a friendly atmosphere, for a precious moment of sharing between our two French and Ghanaian communities. A very beautiful celebration!
