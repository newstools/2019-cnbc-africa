JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) – South Africa’s anti-corruption watchdog said on Friday that President Cyril Ramaphosa had “deliberately misled” parliament about a 500,000 rand ($35,900) donation he received for his campaign to lead the African National Congress (ANC). Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane, who investigates allegations of wrongdoing by state officials, told reporters that Ramaphosa had violated the constitution and breached the executive code of ethics in his reply to parliament in November.
