The workshop focuses on enhancing the capacity of editors to manage their newsrooms effectively and support the professional development of their media teams in light of the changing media landscape.  It will include topics such as investigative reporting, storytelling in the era of digital journalism, fact-checking, and social media-based journalism.  IREX is bringing two international experts with extensive experience in working with editors and newsroom management globally, including in Africa. A total of 25 participants from Addis Ababa and regional mass media agencies will participate.  This workshop is the latest effort by the U.S. embassy to invest in the capacity of professional journalists in Ethiopia.  Other recent projects include a national training program for 160 journalists on investigative reporting on development issues, a joint program with the UK Embassy to provide capacity building and foster cooperation for 400 journalists and government communicators, and the recently announced Fund for Emerging Media in Ethiopia, which seeks to support the long term stability and professional development of emerging private media.
