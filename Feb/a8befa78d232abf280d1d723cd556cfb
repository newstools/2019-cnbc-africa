JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) â€“ South African state power utility Eskom said on Monday that it would implement controlled power cuts for a second day in a row because of a shortage of generating capacity. Eskom said it would cut 2,000 megawatts from the national grid from 0700 GMT, likely until 2000 GMT. Reporting by Alexander Winning; Editing by Kim Coghill
