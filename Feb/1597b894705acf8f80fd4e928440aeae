JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) – South Africa’s struggling state-owned airline is to break into three business units as part of a restructuring plan, its Chief Executive Vuyani Jarana said on Monday. Jarani said the firm – which has not made a profit since 2011 and was given a 5 billion rand bailout last year to shore up its balance sheet – will be split into domestic, regional and international business units, each with their own management.
