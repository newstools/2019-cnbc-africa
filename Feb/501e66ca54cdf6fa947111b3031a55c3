By Kopano Gumbi, CNBC Africa’s markets reporter South Africa’s Minister of Energy, Jeff Radebe believes
the process of awarding of contracts to Independent Power Producers (IPPs) has
been fair and without corruption. Despite nearly three years of delays in
signing off IPP contracts, the minister today said the IPP process has
“earned world acclaim.” Presently, South Africa receives just over 3,776 MW of
power into the grid from renewable producers, which is less than 5 percent of
the total energy sold to consumers. The minister acknowledged that the initial cost of
introducing IPPs was high but that the price has fallen through subsequent bids.
IPPs have now become cost neutral to Eskom, as the cost is passed to the
consumer. After months of consistent power, Eskom has had to
reintroduce load shedding in December and again in February, after seven
generating units went down. Minister Radebe however, said that without IPPs,
load shedding would have been worse.
