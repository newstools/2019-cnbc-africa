By Tom Huddleston Jr. A Los Angeles home that billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk bought in 2014 and transferred to his ex-wife is now on the market for roughly $4.5 million. The home is listed by real estate agency Hilton & Hyland, which describes it as a “sleek, stylish” mid-century modern home in Los Angeles’ Brentwood neighborhood. The house features floor-to-ceiling windows, a saltwater pool and spa, as well as views of the Pacific Ocean and the city. The real estate agency posted a video on YouTube showing off the luxurious property. Musk and his now ex-wife, actress Talulah Riley, paid $3.69 million for the four-bedroom, three-bathroom home five years ago. Property records show that Musk transferred ownership of the home to Riley in October 2016, the year that the couple finalized their divorce. (They were married in 2010.) Musk, who is the CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, has a net worth of $22.3 billion, according to Forbes. He reportedly owns several homes in the Los Angeles area, including a mansion in the Bel Air neighborhood that Musk reportedly paid $24.25 million to buy in 2016.
