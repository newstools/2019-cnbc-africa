The team dispatched an aid convoy to support villages in Al Jazeerah Province, which includes 6,000 food parcels and 200 tents that were distributed to people who lost their homes. The foundation’s delegation was received by Major General Ahmed Hannan Ahmed, Mayor of Al Jazeerah, and several local officials. Abdullah Ali Al Zaabi, Member of the Foundation, said that the aid is being delivered based upon the directives of the UAE’s leadership to support the Sudanese people, adding that the foundation seeks to fully complete its relief programme in Sudan, in cooperation with the local humanitarian aid organisation.
