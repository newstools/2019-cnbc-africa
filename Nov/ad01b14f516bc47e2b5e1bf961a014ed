The Diamond Conference speaks to the core aspirations of the partnership between Government and De Beers Group in support of the aspirations of our producer governments to continue to play a leadership role in the diamond value chain and create economic impact for the communities. Africa is the world’s largest producer of diamonds, producing as much as 50% of global production. To date, Africa has produced over 75%, in value, of the world’s diamonds with more than 1.9 billion carats worth an estimated $US 158 billion mined. The Diamond Conference is the only Diamond specific forum on the African continent and over the past 4 years has evolved in size, influence and significance as a key platform for engagement for the global Diamond Industry. In accordance with the principles of the De Beers value proposition the 2019 Diamond conference will further facilitate our engagement strategy with a primary focus on the 4Cs: Consumer Confidence – the changing consumer landscape, trends and its impact on the diamond value chain. Community – The importance of establishing a multi-stakeholder approach to enhancing the sustainability of diamond equity focusing on Economic, Social and Environmental imperatives. Cluster Development – in terms of the diamond supply chain, innovation, disruption and various factors that impact the industry directly or indirectly. There is need to explore the opportunity to create a self-regulating, evidence-based innovation pipeline that will support commercial longevity in the current global context. Collaboration – the value of collaborative relationships to address shared risks that impact the diamond sector.
