To celebrate the 25th anniversary of Liberation Day, Rwanda Development Board (RDB) gave 100 Rwandans who turn 25 years old this year, a once in a lifetime opportunity to trek the mountain gorillas in Volcanos National Park. This is part of the country's efforts to encourage domestic tourism and cultivate a culture of conservation among Rwandans.
