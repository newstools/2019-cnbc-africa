Gauteng Province is pleased to be hosting the second Africa Investment Forum, as it is a real deal-making platform, rather than a talk-shop. Special Advisor to the Premier of Gauteng, Mduduzi Mbada, spoke to CNBC Africaâ€™s Kenneth Igbomor and Kopano Gumbi earlier about the deals that have changed the game for the Province, and the new projects that they want to bring to bankability.
