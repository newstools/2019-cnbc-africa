Center) in Suiderhof/Windhoek. The center received financial support of $ 115,188.50 (€ 6,427.93) from the micro-projects fund of the German Embassy in Windhoek last year.  The therapy room was fitted with special equipment and a soft floor covering. The children use the room on a daily basis. Through therapeutic exercises they develop their muscles and enhance their agility. The soft flooring reduces the risk of injury. A special success story is that of a student bound to a wheelchair. By exercising and strengthening his muscles daily, he can now stand on his own and move his legs without help. Playfully, the children can thus improve motoric skills, balance and motion. The therapeutic toys purchased for this, such as medicine balls, smaller massage balls, swings and Educo discs (non-slip discs with feet, hands and arrows) are perfect. In addition, an interactive smartboard was procured. This helps children with limited fine motor skills to learn. Students with cerebral palsy or dyslexics especially benefit from it.
