Andrew Stewart, Managing Director for Middle East and Africa at WorldRemit, said: “Cameroon is one of our top ten remittance receiving countries globally, so we are delighted to make it even easier for money transfer recipients in the country to manage their funds. “Previously, only senders of WorldRemit transfers could select whether their money was received by bank deposit, collection as cash or mobile money transfer. The new service gives receivers with or without a bank account full control over how they manage their remittances, enabling them to store funds in a remote account in multiple currencies, send money to other WorldRemit users in the same country, or withdraw their funds at any time via any of our convenient pay-out methods.” For more information on how to send money to Cameroon, click here (https://bit.ly/2ZwbPB4) Distributed by APO Group on behalf of WorldRemit.
