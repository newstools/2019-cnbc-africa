The two Nations have been playing against each other in a 2 leg Tournament called the Elgon Cup.  On the other hand, Zambia and Zimbabwe have also been playing against each other for some time in the Battle of the Zambezi, which sees one nation host the other each year. As Zimbabwe announce its Team for the first round of the games to be played on 13th July, 2019 at a venue to be announced, the Zambia Rugby Union has also been working behind the scenes to ensure a smooth ending of the 2019 Local Rugby League while also putting logistics together for the trip across the border.
