LAGOS (Reuters) – A Nigerian judge on Wednesday adjourned until Oct. 29 a case to resolve a $2 billion tax dispute between telecoms company MTN Group and the country’s attorney general. The attorney general demanded South Africa’s MTN pay the $2 billion in September. The company has said the tax payment demand is without merit, it does not owe the money and the attorney general exceeded his powers in making the request.
