HARARE (Reuters) – Zimbabwe’s high court on Tuesday ordered the release on bail of activist pastor Evan Mawarire, who was arrested on charges of subversion amid violent anti-government protests. Mawarire is one of more than 1,000 people who were arrested in a security crackdown over their alleged roles in demonstrations that took place this month following a hike in fuel prices.
