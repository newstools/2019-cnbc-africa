A seminar on human resources and leadership development for diakonia was held in the West African Republic of Bénin from 13-17 May.  Representatives from churches and church-related organisations gathered for a capacity-building seminar, financed by funds from Brot fuer die Welt, on diakonia and development. Participants came from French-speaking countries across Africa. Sessions explored issues of enhancing leadership capabilities in development and diakonia through creative leadership, strategic planning, time management, optimal use of resources and other aspects of effective leadership in a Christian context. The programme was developed by the World Council of Churches (WCC) with support from the All Africa Conference of Churches. Rev. Matthew Ross, WCC programme executive for Diakonia and Capacity Building, said: “This seminar has been an excellent example of ecumenical co-operation to develop work in leadership capacities in the church in Francophone African nations. “Effective leadership and management skills are essential for effective diakonal and development work; this seminar has helped to enhance such skills. “This has also been an important opportunity to highlight priorities for the World Council of Churches, especially the Thursdays in Black campaign addressing violence against women. I am looking forward to the two further seminars in this series in Nairobi and Maputo.” Distributed by APO Group on behalf of World Council of Churches (WCC).Media filesDownload logo
