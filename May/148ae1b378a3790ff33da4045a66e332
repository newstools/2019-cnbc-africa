If the situation permits, schools in conflict affected areas would re-open on 09 June. To address the education needs, the Ministry of Education launched non- formal education activities targeting some 700 students attending basic and secondary education. The Ministry stated challenges linked to the implementation of this programme including security situation and also the availability of a dedicated budget to pay the teachers overtime, stationery and office equipment.
