Mr. Chainarong Keratiyutwong, Ambassador of Thailand to Egypt, joined 65 Thai people and students in tree-planting voluntary activity on the Auspicious Occasion of the Coronation of King Rama X at Al Azhar Unversity Specialized Hospital. On this connection, Prof. Dr. Muhammad Farouk Hagag, the Director of the hospital, and hospital executives also participated.  Besides celebrating the Auspicious Occasion of the Coronation, the said activity aims not only to express gratitude to Egyptian society for offering Thai citizens working opportunities and education to Thai students at Al Azhar University in particular, but also to raise an awareness of environmental conservation as well as to further strengthen solidarity of Thai community in Egypt. The activity, in turn, will help promote positive image of Thailand and her citizens to Egyptian general public.
