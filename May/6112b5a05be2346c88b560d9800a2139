Download logo A Federal Foreign Office Spokesperson issued the following statement today (19 May) on stepping up assistance measures to combat the world’s second largest outbreak of Ebola:  “The Federal Foreign Office is now providing the WHO with a further four million euros for immediate humanitarian relief in eastern Congo to contain the Ebola outbreak. Germany is thus making a crucial contribution towards curbing this outbreak. The funds will be used to support the treatment of those infected and to finance prevention measures such as vaccinations for those at immediate risk as well as measures in the sphere of hygiene and drinking water supplies. This will complement humanitarian projects run by international organisations or German NGOs and funded by Germany aimed at prevention in neighbouring countries Uganda, Burundi and South Sudan (e.g. regular health screenings at border crossings). To date, there have been no cases of Ebola there.” Distributed by APO Group on behalf of Germany – Federal Foreign Office.
