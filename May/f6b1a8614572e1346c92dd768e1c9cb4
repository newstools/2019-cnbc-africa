To celebrate the power of unity, cooperation and dialogue in Europe and around the world, more than 400 guests happily joined in the celebration of Europe Day 2019 at a reception held at Sierra Lighthouse. The EU Delegation had prepared a video for the occasion with messages on EU in Sierra Leone, which was projected at the entrance. Watch the video.  In the course of the evening, guests were pleasantly surprised by a flash mob dance performed by the teachers and students of the British International School and a vibrant traditional krio cultural dance was brought by the Ballanta Music Academy. For the first time, several sponsors were also present, making the 9th May event in Sierra Leone even more colourful and memorable. Joined by the EU Ambassadors and honorary consuls in Freetown, EU Head of Delegation Tom Vens highlighted that “partnership and cooperation are part of the EU's DNA. In the case of Sierra Leone, this partnership goes back more than 40 years and we are here to stay. A mature partnership relies on an open and constructive dialogue on policy matters and issues of shared concern. We will therefore continue to invest in an open and sincere dialogue to achieve our shared goals. What we want is what you want: a Sierra Leone that is resilient, prosperous, and that cares for all its citizens.” He further underlined that “Democracy cannot function without compromise” and underscored that “we will not make meaningful progress if we do not redouble our efforts to give women and girls, and other vulnerable groups, their rightful place in society. We are stepping up our engagement in this area.” Distributed by APO Group on behalf of European External Action Service (EEAS).Media filesDownload logo
