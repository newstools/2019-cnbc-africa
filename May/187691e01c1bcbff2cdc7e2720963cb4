IFP spokesperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa, speaking to CNBC Africa’s Fifi Peters said that he hoped the numbers would pick up as vote counting progressed. The party came into the election on the back foot after a number of setbacks, but the work they have put in is beginning to pay off and this is being reflected in the numbers, he said. They also spoke about the youth representation in the vote, leadership plans for the party and the IFP’s position on coalitions.
