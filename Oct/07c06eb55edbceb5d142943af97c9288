The participation of Tunisian citizens in this presidential election, as well as in the legislative elections held on 6 October has been a new lesson of civic and democratic culture. Spain wishes also to highlight the work of the Independent High Authority for Elections for its efficient organization of this new electoral cycle. For this new era, Spain wishes to reiterate its commitment to Tunisia as a neighbour and a friend, and reassures its will to continue nurturing the strong bonds between both countries, from which both our peoples and the entire Euro-Mediterranean space may benefit.
