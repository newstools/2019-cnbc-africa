A new booked launched in Joburg this week, it promises to take the readers back into the dark days of struggle in Southern Africa. It's written by a judge in the supreme court of Namibia, David Smuts, and is a memoir of his battle as a young lawyer in the 1980s to speak truth to power during the desperate days of the country’s border war with Angola. He spoke to CNBC Africa’s Chris Bishop.
