Another board member at Old Mutual has resigned, a month after Pinky Moholi did. Karabo Morule stepped down as Managing Director of Old Mutual Personal Finance with effect from October 18, 2019 for personal reasons. She will remain in her role for three months to assist with the transition to an internal successor. Old Mutual is currently in a court battle with its ousted CEO Peter Moyo, who seeks reinstatement after being fired in June. Moyo also wants the courts to find Chairman Trevor Manuel and 13 board members to be in contempt of court for twice firing him as CEO and thrice barring him from returning to his corner office at the Sandton-based insurance company, after the court ruled in his favour.
